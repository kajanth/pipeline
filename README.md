# pipeline

`pipeline` is a tool to help with quick iteration on complex shell pipelines.

Pipe some data into `pipeline`, and edit your pipeline while watching the
output in real time. When you're satisfied, hit escape to have its output
piped to the next stage.

Inspired by, but quite different from, https://github.com/peco/peco.
